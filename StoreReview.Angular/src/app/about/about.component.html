        ASP.NET Core is a new open-source and cross-platform framework for
        building modern cloud based internet connected applications, such as web
        apps, IoT apps and mobile backends. ASP.NET Core apps can run on .NET
        Core or on the full .NET Framework. It was architected to provide an
        optimized development framework for apps that are deployed to the cloud
        or run on-premises. It consists of modular components with minimal
        overhead, so you retain flexibility while constructing your solutions.
        You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core apps cross-platform on
        Windows, Mac and Linux. ASP.NET Core is open source at GitHub.
